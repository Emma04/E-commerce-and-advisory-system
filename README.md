# E-commerce-and-advisory-system
We are using shopizer as an e-commerce platform and an advisory system

Shopizer is an open source platform. You can find more details at http://www.shopizer.com/ and to download it follow those steps https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer. 
We added some products in the database. Please add the sql file in your sql database after creating database called salesmanager. It will generate some products as sample. You can just dismiss the sql file if you want to create your own products. You will add directly via the e-commerce platform or generate a script to add directly in the database instead on entering one by one. This data will be analysed and give powerful advises for shop's owner. We also added google anaytic in the e-commerce platform to tracks users and we have a basic dashboard. We can collect the browser's languages, countries they are coming from, page viewed, comparaison by month's, weeks... You can add more features by google analytics api. You can add as many as you wish =)
